- **CDN-Based Infrastructure**: Boosts performance, minimizes operational complexity, and simplifies upkeep.
- **Modular Architecture**: Constructed with modular elements for straightforward scaling, feature additions, and adaptability.

## Real-World Effect & Quantifiable Results

This platform has the potential to generate substantial real-world impact by:

- **Promoting SDG Alignment**: Motivates individuals and organizations to contribute to global challenges by aligning their initiatives with the SDGs.
- **Facilitating Funding Access**: Connects projects with suitable funding sources, improving the chances of implementation and measurable community impact. We aim to assist in launching three TEDAI For Good Hackathon concepts within the initial year.

## Scalability & Worldwide Reach

- **Serverless Design**: Permits efficient scaling to satisfy global demand and ensures platform robustness.
- **Multilingual Capability**: AI-driven NLP facilitates localization, making the tool adaptable to various languages and regions for wider accessibility. (Refer to Responsible AI for specifics on the localization strategy).

## User-Friendliness & Universal Accessibility

- **Extensive Documentation**: Offers clear and readily available documentation to enable non-profit organizations to comprehend, replicate, or modify the tool.

## Responsible AI & Ethical Framework

- **Data Privacy Assurance**: Minimizes collection of personal information and prioritizes user privacy.
- **Transparency & Interpretability**: Delivers transparent and understandable recommendations, with clear attribution for funding opportunity sources.
- **Limitations & Mitigation Approaches**:
  - **Funding Identification:** The fluctuating nature of grant funding poses challenges. We address this through a curated database, intelligent filtering with advanced NLP, and human-in-the-loop verification for key projects.
  - **Localization:** High-quality localization is resource-intensive. Our approach involves professional translation for core components, augmented by community-sourced translation and prioritized language support based on user demand. AI-powered translation will be used for initial drafts and to assist the translation workflow.
  - **Scalability:** Meeting global demand necessitates robust infrastructure. We utilize serverless architecture, CDN integration, and ongoing performance monitoring and optimization.
  - **Usability:** Crafting intuitive interfaces requires iterative design. We adhere to user-centered design principles, conduct beta testing, and continually integrate user feedback.

## Technical Stack Requirements

- Next.js (JavaScript front-end framework)
- FastAPI (Python back-end framework)

# Talks Semantic Search Backend

A semantic search engine designed to connect inspirational talks (e.g., TEDx Talks) with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Overview

The **semantic-talks-search-backend** component implements semantic search to locate relevant talks (from a publicly available dataset) based on queries related to SDGs. The system analyzes talk transcripts and descriptions to match them with SDG themes and user inquiries.

## Technical Implementation Details

The search engine employs several key technologies:

- **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)

  - Converts textual data into numerical vectors that represent word importance.
  - Facilitates efficient text comparison and matching.

- **Cosine Similarity**

  - Measures the similarity score between query vectors and document vectors.
  - Ranks search results based on these relevance scores.

- **scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer**
  - Generates a sparse TF-IDF matrix from talk transcripts and descriptions.
  - Optimizes memory utilization and computational speed.

### Example Query

To search for content related to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy):

```bash
GET https://tedxsdg-search-backend.vercel.app/api/search?query=sdg7
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "score": 0.540540832015223,
      "document": {
        "slug": "ksenia_petrichenko_what_if_buildings_created_energy_instead_of_consuming_it",
        "description": "Buildings are bad news for the climate -- but they don't have to beâ€¦",
        "presenterDisplayName": "Ksenia Petrichenko",
        "transcript": "â€¦ Buildings that can consume and produce energy efficiently, interact with a smart grid and respond to its signals, providing flexibility and bringing us closer to our climate targetsâ€¦ ",
        "sdg_tags": ["sdg7"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Response Fields

- `score`: Relevance score based on cosine similarity (ranges from 0 to 1).
- `document`: Contains information about the matched talk.
  - `slug`: A unique identifier for the talk.
  - `description`: A summary of the talk.
  - `presenterDisplayName`: The name of the speaker.
  - `transcript`: The transcript from the talk.
